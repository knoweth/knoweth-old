# queue types: 0=new/cram, 1=lrn, 2=rev, 3=day lrn, -1=suspended, -2=buried
# day learning = cards in the learning queue that crossed from one day to the next without graduating to review
By default, Anki brings up your daily cards in this order:

1. learning cards that are due
2. (optional) new cards if your preferences are set to have them first
3. review cards
4. "day learning" cards, which are cards in the learning queue that crossed from one day to the next without graduating to the review queue.
5. (optional) new cards if your preferences put them last

if was new card:
	move to learning
	initialize # of reps required to graduate
if currently learning or day learning:
	answer learning card:
		EASY = immediate graduate, reschedule as review card
		GOOD = one step toward graduation [something about lefts]
		AGAIN =
			reset left to normal
			reschedule card (we aren't implementing dynamic decks so)
			interval = max(1, conf['minInt'], card.interval * conf['mult'])
		delay = delayForGrade(conf, card.left) # get the delay (1 min, 10 min, etc.)
		set the due date of the card
		if the card is due today:
			put it back into the review queue
		otherwise:
			use the day learn queue
otherwise, if currently a review card:
	answer review card:
		AGAIN = rescheduleLapse
			# check leech, dynamic decks, etc.
			delay as Delay #0
			interval = max(conf['minInt'], card.interval * conf['mult'])
		otherwise -> rescheduleRev
			factor = # do the ease of 1.3, the hard,good,easy adjustment of the ease factor
			set the interval accordingly
record time taken

Interval calculation:
- Get delay
- Get ease factor
- All intervals multiplied by interval multiplier and must be at least 1 day later than a *prev* interval
- HARD interval: (interval + delay / 4) * 1.2
- GOOD interval: (interval + delay / 2) * easeFactor, at least 1 day later than HARD interval
- EASY interval: (interval + delay) * easeFactor * (extra ease multiplier), at least one day later than GOOD interval
- Use the proper interval
- Cap it to (max interval) if necessary
